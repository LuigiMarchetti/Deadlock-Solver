# Deadlock Analyzer

## Project Overview
This Deadlock Analyzer is a graphical application developed as part of a work assignment for the Computer Science program at FURB University, 6th semester, 2024. The project aims to visualize and analyze potential deadlock situations in resource allocation systems.

## Features
- Interactive GUI for creating process and resource nodes
- Ability to add edges representing resource requests and allocations
- Deadlock avoidance algorithm visualization
- Clear and intuitive user interface

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Tkinter for GUI

## How to Run
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Navigate to the project directory.
4. Run the following command:
   ```
   python deadlock_analyzer.py
   ```

## Usage
- Use the buttons to add processes (P) and resources (R) to the canvas.
- Click and drag to move nodes around.
- Use the "Add Edge" button to create connections between processes and resources.
- Click "Avoid Deadlock" to run the deadlock avoidance algorithm and visualize the results.
